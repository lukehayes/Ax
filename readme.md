# AX

Ax is a small rendering 'Engine' written with C++ to aid in abstracting some of the lower level OpenGL boilerplate necessary with creating 2D/3D visualizations.

Personal goals of this project are to:

* Learn more about mathematics/linear algebra
* Create a usable C++ project to help making visualizations
* Learn more about modern C++
* Learn more about build systems and compilers
* Gain a better understanding of cross-platform development

### Dependencies

* GLEW
* GLFW
* GLM Math Library
* OpenGL 3.3+
* A C++ compiler (gcc, g++, clang for Linux/OSX) (cl for Windows)

### Building 

#### Linux
* `git clone` the project
* `cd` into the project folder
* run `make`
* run `./bin/app` binary

#### Windows
* `git clone` the project
* Move into the project directory
* Run `compile\build.bat`
* Run `bin\app.exe` binary
